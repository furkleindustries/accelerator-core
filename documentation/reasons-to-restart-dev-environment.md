# Reasons you will likely need to restart the dev environemnt

Some changes made to author-facing content will update automatically. Others will not, and you will have to restart the task. The following is a non-exhaustive list of reasons you will likely find yourself in the latter position.

* Changed a font or font subset setting.
* Added, renamed, or removed a passage, header, footer, or plugin.
* Altered any of the configuration or scripting in `/config/`.
* Updated a package.

More will be added to this page as needed.
