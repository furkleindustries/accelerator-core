# Changelog

This file lists descriptions of top-level changes to the Accelerator framework as generated by the `accelerator-tool` devtool.

* `0.11.0`
  * Added a custom font loading which produces all the necessary parts for a best-practices font loading strategy based on a simple JS configuration object.
  * Added facades for `@material-ui/core` components
  * Added a loading screen with an exposed API for critical, asynchronous loading logic, and progress indication to the reader.
  * Externalized rendering function and added an Ink-like scroll-type renderer.
  * Added an auto-assembled menu widget based on user-creatable, tool-generatable story option assets. This widget also includes contextual rendering of menu objects based on visibility tree, a breadcrumb navigation bar, and the ability to expose to users the mutation of serializable option values, e.g. through form inputs.
  * Updated all dependencies to ES modules and included paths for external packages to offer ES Modules for tree-shaken build consumption.
  * Rearranged passage objects so that state is injected as props rather than being connected to the store. This allows present-state-agnostic rendering, which is necessary for scroll rendering and other more exotic options.
  * Added `coreVersion` and `toolVersion` properties to the Accelerator config.
